# Google-Play-Store-EDA-Project---Python
This project explores and analyzes the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights into app trends, ratings, and user behavior. Using Python, Pandas, and NumPy, the analysis focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis .  The goal is to understand what factors influence an app’s success  such as category size, price, installs, and ratings — and to visualize meaningful patterns in the app ecosystem.

**Technologies Used**
**Language:** Python
**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
**Libraries:**
**pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
**numpy** – for numerical operations and transformations
**matplotlib** – for data visualizations and data cleaning.

**Dataset Information**
**Source: Google Play Store Apps Dataset (Kaggle)**
**Description:**
The dataset contains details about apps available on the Google Play Store, including:
App Name,CategoryRating, Reviews, Size, Installs Type (Free/Paid), Price Content, Rating ,Genres, Last Updated.


**Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps**
1.Performed extensive data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
2.Removed duplicate entries and null values.
3.Converted columns to correct data types such as  Reviews, Installs, Price.
4.Cleaned categorical data and handled inconsistent formatting
5.Replaced missing Rating values using imputation techniques
6.Extracted features such as numeric installs, cleaned price.
7.Standardized units for size and reviews.
