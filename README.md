# Google-Play-Store-EDA-Project---Python
This project explores and analyzes the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights into app trends, ratings, and user behavior. Using Python, Pandas, and NumPy, the analysis focuses on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis .  The goal is to understand what factors influence an app’s success  such as category size, price, installs, and ratings — and to visualize meaningful patterns in the app ecosystem.

**Technologies Used**
**Language:** Python
**Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
**Libraries:**
**pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning
**numpy** – for numerical operations and transformations
**matplotlib** – for data visualizations and data cleaning.

**Dataset Information**
**Source: Google Play Store Apps Dataset (Kaggle)**
**Description:**
The dataset contains details about apps available on the Google Play Store, including:
App Name,CategoryRating, Reviews, Size, Installs Type (Free/Paid), Price Content, Rating ,Genres, Last Updated.


**Data Cleaning & Transformation Steps**
1.Performed extensive data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy
2.Removed duplicate entries and null values.
3.Converted columns to correct data types such as  Reviews, Installs, Price.
4.Cleaned categorical data and handled inconsistent formatting

**Key Insights**
1.Free apps dominate the Play Store, but Paid apps tend to have slightly higher average ratings.
2.Game and Family categories have the highest install counts.
3.Apps with frequent updates tend to maintain better ratings.
4.Large-sized apps generally receive more downloads in entertainment and gaming categories.
5.Replaced missing Rating values using imputation techniques
6.Extracted features such as numeric installs, cleaned price.
7.Standardized units for size and reviews.

**Future Enhancements**
1.Perform sentiment analysis on user reviews using NLP.
2.Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI or Plotly.
3.Deploy results as a data app using Streamlit.
4.Include predictive modeling to forecast app success factors.

**Summary and Learnings of EDA Project**
1.Learned how to clean, transform, and prepare real-world data using Pandas and NumPy.
2.Understood how to handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types effectively.
3.Created new features like is_free, log_installs, and days_since_update to make data more useful for analysis.
4.Explored patterns between app ratings, installs, categories, and price types.
5.Improved skills in data storytelling — turning data into meaningful conclusions.
6.Enhanced technical confidence in Python, Jupyter Notebook, and data visualization.
7.Learned to organize analysis projects with a clean, structured, and professional workflow.
